# Gruby
This is a simple GRUB2 theme that I manually put together in my admiration for the [Gruvbox colorscheme](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) which I'm completely obsessed with at this point.

## Contribution
It is a work in progress, especially when it comes to icons and such, so contributions are very welcome.
